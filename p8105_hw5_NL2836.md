# Question 1

##### Import dataset from CSV file.

``` r
homicide <- read_csv("homicide-data.csv")
```

##### Describe the raw data.

This dataset includes 52179 observations and 12 variables, reporting the
date, the city, the state, the coordinates of the incidences, the
victims’ name, age, race, gender, and the disposition of the case. The
incidences are reported across 28 states from 2007-2017.

##### Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homicide =
  homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) 
 
city_summary =
  homicide %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    city_total= n(), 
    city_unsolved= sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))
  )
```

- From 2007-2017, Chicago had the highest number of total number of
  homicides and also the highest number of unsolved homicides. Tulsa, AL
  only had 1 reported case and 0 reported unsolved case, which might
  have been due to missing reports. If we exclude Tulsa, AL then Tampa,
  FL had both the lowest number of total homicides and the lowest number
  of unsolved homicides.

##### For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
baltimore =
  city_summary %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

test =
  prop.test(
  x= baltimore %>% pull(city_unsolved),
  n = baltimore %>%pull(city_total))%>% 
  broom::tidy()

test
```
